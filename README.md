I used our custom backend API. To launch project you should follow next steps.
1. Download and unzip this file https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rEjRHkYLpvEQ9oUIzymgBH4Mb1LnJw0k/view?usp=sharing
2. Сheck if you have docker installed.
3. In the console go to the root test_task folder and launch 
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose-up
4. Сheck if you have postman installed.
5. We open postman. In the post-request on the url http://localhost/api/users, create users as in the screenshot.
6. Go to http://localhost/ as in the screenshot
7. There is much more information on the backend here http://localhost/api/docs/
